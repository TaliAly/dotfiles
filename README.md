# Allyson Rowe's Dotfiles

A simple storage for my dotfiles in my linux machine.
I'm using [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) as my manager for dotfiles, in case that you're interested.

About me:
- Linux user | Open Suse

## Requirements
Set [fish](https://fishshell.com/) as your main shell

```
chsh -s $(which fish)
```
## Instalation

git clone https://github.com/TaliAly/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

# or if you prefer ssh
git clone git@github.com:TaliAly/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

```

## Credit
This repo has a lot of code adapted/implemented from [Theprimeagen's dotfiles](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles), so you should really go check it out.
