# Allyson Rowe's Dotfiles

A simple storage for my dotfiles in my linux machine.
I'm using [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) as my manager for dotfiles, in case that you're interested.

About me:
- Linux user | Open Suse
- Neovim
- Dead simple

## Requirements
Set [fish](https://fishshell.com/) as your main shell

```
chsh -s $(which fish)
```

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
- [Neovim | Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart)
- [Fisher | Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)


## Instalation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TaliAly/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

# or if you prefer ssh
git clone git@github.com:TaliAly/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

```

and then just run
```sh

```
